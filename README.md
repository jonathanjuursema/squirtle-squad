This repository contains a Java implementation of the board game Qwirkle. It has been developed by Jonathan Juursema and Peter Wessels as part of programming course at the University of Twente.

The software includes a server which can host multiple games and a client to connect players to the server. It uses the protocol described [here](https://github.com/mmmcompany/QuirkleInterfaceRepository), which has been set between several groups of students. This way all clients can connect to all servers.

The software also includes an AI which can play the game on its own. This AI is initially ment to play against the AI's of other student groups in a final tournament, but can also serve as a computer opponent.
