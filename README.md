This repository contains a Java implementation of the board game Qwirkle. It has been developed by Jonathan Juursema and Peter Wessels as part of programming course at the University of Twente.

The software includes a server which can host multiple games and a client to connect players to the server. It uses the protocol described [here](https://github.com/mmmcompany/QuirkleInterfaceRepository), which has been set between several groups of students. This way all clients can connect to all servers.

The software also includes an AI which can play the game on its own. This AI is initially ment to play against the AI's of other student groups in a final tournament, but can also serve as a computer opponent.



**Installation**

The software can be loaded into Eclipse and be run from there by running the App.java class. The App.java class can also be compiled to run the game into any terminal that supports running Java programs.


**Requirements**

No additional Java libraries are necessary to play and run the game. It may only be necessary to use JUnit 4 to run the unit tests.
